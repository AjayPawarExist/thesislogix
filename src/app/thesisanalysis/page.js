       Data analysis involves the judgment of results from the collected primary and secondary data through the use of applicable statistical tools and methods, as well as the understanding of outcomes. Many research students may find this task extremely problematic, as they may not have the knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and tests. Thus, it becomes difficult to handle a large amount of research data, as well as to filter, structure, and analyze it with precision.
