            WHAT ARE IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES?

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Implementation services are provided by both software companies and
            IT consultancies to help customers realize value from their product
            purchase. The implementation team will have responsibility for
            getting the customer live with the product and in turn achieving the
            initial value milestone. The type of product and the associated
            complexity dictates the type of team, timeline and implementation
            methodology needed.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Companies implementing less complex products will often focus on
            having rapid deployment times, ideally with self-service elements to
            the onboarding phase to help scale. As the complexity of the
            solution grows or with acquisition of enterprise customers often
            sees vendors needing to develop a more professional approach to
            project management underpinned by a PMO.

            Clear & consistent project plans are the cornerstone of effective
            project management. Your customer may not have a full time project
            manager and is having to coordinate a mix of stakeholders on their
            side. Curate project information, customer tasks and dependencies
            effectively so that the customer knows what they need to do and
            when, to plan ahead.

            Project managers need to be setup for success with clear policy on
            managing budget and timelines. If you are selling fixed price
            implementations, it is easy to fall into the trap of allowing scope
            to creep to please the customer. Foster a culture where the team
            take a prescriptive approach and coaches the customer through the
            implementation processes quickly and effectively.

            Failed implementations lead to churn - Gartner research found $5b in
            annual churn due to poor onboarding. Speed to value should be the
            guiding principle of your delivery methodology. The quality and
            velocity of implementations have an outsized impact on the customer
            relationship where first impressions matter.

            As Saood Shah, former VP of Professional Services at Gainsight,
            states “Optimizing for time-to-value had a significant impact on any
            services organization that I’ve been a part of with the
            corresponding impact on revenue generation, customer retention,
            expansion sales and overall customer confidence.”

            HOW DELIVERY TIMES IMPACT REVENUE
          </h1>
          <p>
            he best professional services team understands the financial impact
            of faster implementations. Accounting standards mean that companies
            can increasingly only recognize revenue part way through an
            implementation or at go-live. In telephony technology projects, the
            software licences are provisioned at go-live - for one publicly
            traded telecoms company, one of their business units booked $100m in
            ARR but only recognized $40m within the financial year due to delays
            in delivery.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Companies that can improve the consistency and velocity of delivery
            will not only drive better retention rates but also have a
            significantimpact on the financial performance of the company.

            Customer success starts with customer onboarding. You can build

            of services delivery including resourcing, project management,
            customer collaboration and financial management. Project plans
            including resource requirements are created based on the
            Professional Services package sold in Salesforce. Your onboarding
            playbooks are mapped to customer segments, products, or your own
            criteria all within Salesforce.
